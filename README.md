# project-euler
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical / computer programming problems.

Both Python files provided in this repository provide my solutions to 50 Project Euler problems. 
* The hard_project_euler_problem_solutions.py file specificially focuses on the harder Project Euler problems.

<br />

Each Project Euler problem's solution is written as a Python function, allowing for improved readability and maintainance. The aim is to run each function and output a solution in under 2 minutes, hence efficiency of the code is vital in this challenge. 

Three txt files are also provided in this repository as some of the problems require these files to be used.
